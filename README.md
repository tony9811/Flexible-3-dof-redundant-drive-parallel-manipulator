This project is my university thesis

Kinematic analysis of paraller-manipulator,including forward and inverse kinematic 
solution，Jacobian matrix，singularity analysis， scale synthesis and reachable 
workspace，trajectory  planning of the manipulator.

With the continuous commercial application of robots in the field of high speed 
material handling and sorting, many food packaging processing still adopts the 
traditional manual classification and packaging, the traditional mode of vibration 
screening, it is necessary to replace the traditional extensive packaging mode by the 
automatic mechanical production mode. The parallel manipulator has the advantages 
of stronger bearing capacity, higher precision and faster speed than the series robot, 
which can well overcome the disadvantages of low efficiency, high cost and easy 
pollution in simple and repetitive work such as manual packaging and vibration 
screening. In view of the demand for high-speed parallel manipulator in food packaging 
production line, a flexible 3-dof redundant parallel manipulator is designed and 
developed in this subject.

The inverse kinematics solution of manipulator is obtained by solving the 
closed loop constraint equation based on geometric relation. On this basis, the 
kinematics positive solution is obtained by Newton iteration method. Then the velocity 
Jacobian matrix and the acceleration constraint equation of the manipulator are 
established, and based on which the singularity analysis and scale synthesis are carried 
out. Finally, the numerical method is used to solve and draw the reachable workspace 
of the manipulator, in which the curve of quintic polynomial is used for trajectory 
planning.
